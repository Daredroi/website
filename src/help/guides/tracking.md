# Tracking Info

<ul>
  <li>Tracking is manually done for every manga manually. </li>
  <li>The last page of the chapter must be reached to have it mark the chapter as read and track it.</li>
  <li>You can manually set the chapter by tapping on the number and then either entering the number in or dragging the ticker up or down.</li>
  <li>After being offline, the tracker will not update to the latest , even after going back online.</li>
  <li>Tracking in Tachiyomi syncs Tachiyomi's tracking status to the tracker, not the other way around.</li>
</ul>
